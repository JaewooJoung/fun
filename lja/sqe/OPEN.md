## Key Aspects:
- Awareness of SW quality
- Resource availability
- Process definitions

### Expected Evidence:
1. Written documentation
2. Version control
3. Risk Mitigation Plan

---

# Question 2: "Can you show?"

## Demonstration Requirements:
- Live system access
- Working examples
- Process walkthrough

### Verification Methods:
1. System demos
2. Code reviews
3. Documentation reviews

---

# Question 3: "Can you give?"

## Knowledge Transfer:
- Training materials
- Documentation
- Peer reviews

### Collaboration Requirements:
- Team workshops
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Documentation updates

---
# Question 4: "Is it good?"

## Quality Criteria:
- Performance metrics
- User satisfaction
- Code quality

## Assessment Methods:
- Peer reviews
- Metrics analysis
- User feedback

---

# Grading Levels

## Outstanding (100%)
- Complete documentation
- Excellent demonstration
- Effective knowledge transfer
- High quality delivery

## Excellent (80%)
- Good documentation
- Clear demonstration
- Adequate knowledge transfer

---

# Grading Levels (continued)

## Poor (40%)
- Incomplete documentation
- Limited demonstration
- Minimal knowledge transfer

## Nothing (0%)
- No documentation
- No demonstration
- No knowledge transfer

---

# Poor Compliance Warning

![bg right:40%](https://jaewoojoung.github.io/fun/sqe/warning.jpeg)

## Risk Factors:
- Incomplete documentation
- Poor knowledge transfer
- Lack of standardization

### Prevention:
1. Frequent audits
2. Continuous monitoring
3. Shorter training time

# What's next?
Making a SW for our team members to easily score the OPEN system

## Tried:
1. ROBOHELP - Too static --> revoke soon
2. POWER BI -  good but we only have read access on DB--> revoke soon
3. HTML - PROS: WWW is the easiest and fast / CONS: suppliers can see it 
4. JAVA - PROS: we already have RED JDK to run the SW / CONS: Time consuming

---

# SW Examples
![bg right:50%](https://jaewoojoung.github.io/fun/sqe/wow.png)
## HTML Stories:
- Project A: Implementation results
- Project B: Quality improvements

## JAVA Stories:
- Incomplete documentation
- Poor communication
- Lack of follow-up
